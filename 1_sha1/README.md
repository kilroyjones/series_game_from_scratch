### SHA-1 in Rust

This is part of a project I'm working on where I plan to build a game using the Rust standard library. Each part is a project unto itself, with this being an implementation of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm that I will use in the websocket library.

You can find an article going over this [here](https://www.thespatula.io/rust/rust_sha1/) and a video [here](https://youtu.be/A_VMlxonLXs).

To set this up you need to clone the repo and run it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kilroyjones/sha1-tutorial/
cd sha1-tutorial
cargo run
```

As long as you have Rust installed it should run immediately.
