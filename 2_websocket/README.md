You can test the code out on your own by following the steps in the README or the directions below.

First, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kilroyjones/websockets_from_scratch
```

Then run it:

```bash
cd websockets_from_scratch/2_websocket
cargo run
```

In the same folder, there is a client folder which contains a single HTML page that can be run to test the server. How you run this is up to you, but if you have python3 installed, you can do:

````bash
python3 -m http.server
```

After that, youâ€™ll be able to navigate to http://localhost:8000 and see that everything is working.
