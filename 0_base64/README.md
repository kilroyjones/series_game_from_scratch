### Base64 in Rust

This is part of a project I'm working on where I plan to build a game using the Rust standard library. Each part is a project unto itself, with this being an implementation of the Base64 that I will use in the websocket library.

You can find an [article](https://www.thespatula.io/rust/rust_base64/) going over this here and a [video](https://youtu.be/VYU38e-g9sM) here.

To set this up you need to clone the repo and run it:

```
git clone https://github.com/kilroyjones/bas64-tutorial/
cd base64-tutorial
cargo run
```

As long as you have Rust installed it should run immediately.
